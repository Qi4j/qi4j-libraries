<h1>Alarm Syatems</h1>

<p>
    Alarm Systems are originally used in Industrial Automation and Process Control systems, to monitor the health
    of external devices and software functions in large scale plants. The semantics in an Alarm system are well-defined
    and allows for excellent aggregation and overviews, fine-grained workflow of system health issues and
    rich data sets around any issues.
</p>

<p>
    This Alarm System, that is based on Qi4j's excellent persistence support, is an attempt at bringing a first-class
    model from the industrial automation world into the enterprise of large-scale software systems, that nowadays
    are so large and un-wieldly that log files, syslog and emails can no longer cope with the burden of management
    needs.
</p>

<h1>The Conceptual Model</h1>

<p>
    Although the inner details of an alarm system can be hard to fully understand, the conceptual model is fairly
    straight forward, and can be described with <i>Alarm</i>,<i>Alarm Trigger</i>, <i>Alarm Status</i> and <i>
    Alarm Event</i>. The behavior of the Alarm state machine, hence the workflow, is dictated by an <i>Alarm Model</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Looking at each of these in greater detail.
</p>

<h2>Alarm</h2>

<p>
    An Alarm is a tiny state-machine that tracks the <i>Alarm State</i> (see below). An Alarm has certain attributes
    that
    are always present and custom attributes that are suitable for the domain in which the Alarm is being used. The
    <i>Alarm Class</i> and <i>Alarm Category</i> are attributes that are always present, together with an <i>Alarm
    Name</i>
    and an <i>Alarm Description</i>.
</p>

<h2>Alarm Class</h2>

<p>
    There are 4 <i>Alarm Classes</i>, A to D, indicating the urgency if an <i>Alarm Event</i> is occurring on the Alarm.
</p>

<h2>Alarm Category</h2>

<p>
    <i>Alarm Category</i> is a required attribute on the Alarm to indicate the target audience that needs to be informed
    about it. This can be used to differentiate between infrastructure concerns versus domain model issues, or direct
    <i>Alarm Events</i> to different recipients.
</p>

<h1>Alarm Model</h1>
<p>
    The <i>Alarm Model</i> defines which <i>Alarm Status</i> types, <i>Alarm Event</i> types, <i>Alarm Triggers</i> and
    the behavior of the state machine in the <i>Alarm</i> itself.
</p>
<p>
    There is one default (configurable) <i>Alarm Model</i> which will be assigned to any created <i>Alarm</i> but it can
    be set on each <i>Alarm</i> individually. This allows for the greatest flexibility, yet easy enough to use.
</p>

<h1>Alarm Status</h1>
<p>
    The <i>Alarm</i> always has an <i>Alarm Status</i>. Most <i>Alarm Models</i> will have a <b>Normal</b> status which
    the <i>Alarm</i> is set to initially, and <b>Activated</b> is likely to be present as well. The <i>Alarm Status</i>
    only changes from one status to another through the use of an <i>Alarm Trigger</i>, but all triggers doesn't
    cause the <i>Alarm Status</i> to change.
</p>
<h1>Alarm Event</h1>
<p>
    Whenever an <i>Alarm</i> changes its <i>Alarm Status</i> an <i>Alarm Event</i> is sent to all <i>Alarm
    Listeners</i>. <i>Alarm Listeners</i> are registered to the <i>Alarm System</i>. <i>Alarm Event</i> types are
    defined by the <i>Alarm Model</i>. Some common <i>Alarm Event</i> types/names are "activation", "acknowledgement"
    and "deactivation".

</p>
<h1>Alarm Trigger</h1>
<p>
    <i>Alarm Triggers</i> are used to forward the workflow. The <i>Alarm Model</i> defines the available <i>Alarm
    Triggers</i> which are all plain Strings. <i>Alarm Triggers</i> are "commanding" such as "block", "activate" and
    "disable".
