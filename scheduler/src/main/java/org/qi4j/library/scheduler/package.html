        <h2>Qi4j Library - Scheduler</h2>

        <h3>Logging</h3>
        <p>The SLF4J Logger used by this library is named "org.qi4j.library.scheduler".</p>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <p>Use {@link SchedulerAssembler} to add the {@link Scheduler} service to your {@link Application}. This
            Assembler provide a fluent api to programmatically configure configuration defaults and activate the
            {@link Timeline} service assembly that allow to browse in past and future {@link Task} runs.</p>
        <p>Here is a full example:</p>
        <pre>
        new SchedulerAssembler().
              visibleIn( Visibility.layer ).
              withConfigAssembly( configModuleAssembly ).
              withPulseRhythm( 60 ).
              withGarbageCollectorRhythm( 600 ).
              withTimeline().
              assemble( moduleAssembly );
        </pre>
        <p>See {@link SchedulerConfiguration} for configuration properties details, the values show above are the defaults.</p>

        <h3>Writing Tasks</h3>
        <p>To write a schedulable Task, compose an EntityComposite using {@link Task} to be able to schedule it.</p>
        <p>A Task is wrapped in a {@link ScheduleRunner} before being run by {@link SchedulerWorkQueue}.
            {@link ScheduleRunner} wrap a {@link UnitOfWork} around the {@link Task#run()} invocation.</p>
        <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
        <pre>
        interface MyTaskEntity
            extends Task, EntityComposite
        {
            Property&lt;String&gt; customState();
            Association&lt;AnotherEntity&gt; anotherEntity();
        }

        abstract class MyTaskMixin
            implements Runnable
        {
            @This MyTaskEntity me;
            public void run()
            {
                me.customState().set( me.anotherEntity().get().doSomeStuff( me.customState().get() ) );
            }
        }
        </pre>
        <p>{@link Task}s have a mandatory name property and an optional tags property. Theses properties get copied in
            each {@link TimelineRecord}s recorder when the Timeline feature is activated.</p>

        <h3>Scheduling Tasks</h3>
        <p>{@link Task}s are scheduled using the {@Sheduler} service. This creates a {@link Schedule} associated to
            the {@link Task} that allows you to know if it is running, to change it's cron expression and set it's
            durability.</p>
        <p>By default, a {@link Schedule} is not durable. In other words, it do not survive an {@link Application}
            restart. To make a {@link Schedule} durable, set it's durable property to true once its scheduled. Durable
            {@link Schedule}s that have no future run are removed by {@link SchedulerGarbageCollector}.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>There are two ways to schedule a {@link Task} using the {@link Scheduler} service: once or with a cron
            expression.</p>

        <h4>Scheduling once</h4>
        <p>This is the easiest way to run a background {@link Task} once after a given initial delay in seconds</p>
        <pre>
        @Service Scheduler scheduler;
        public void function() {
            MyTaskEntity myTask = ...;
            Schedule schedule = scheduler.scheduleOnce( myTask, 10 ); // myTask will be run in 10 seconds from now
        }
        </pre>
        <p>Note that there is no point in making such a {@link Schedule} durable because it won't be run repeatedly.</p>

        <h4>Scheduling using a cron expression</h4>
        <p>Cron expressions handling is based on the <a href="https://github.com/eskatos/sked">sked</a> project.</p>
        <p>Here is an exceprt from it's javadoc:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Cron expression parsing is based on the GNU crontab manpage that can be found here:
                <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?crontab+5">http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?crontab+5</a>.</p>
            <p>The following extensions are used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a mandatory field is added at the begining: seconds.</li>
                <li>a special string is added: @minutely</li>
                <li>a special character is added: ? to choose between dayOfMonth and dayOfWeek</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ? special char has the same behavior as in the Quartz Scheduler expression. The wikipedia page
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRON_expression">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRON_expression</a>
                explains Quartz Scheduler expression, not simple cron expressions. You'll find there about the ? special
                char and maybe that some other extensions you would like to use are missing in this project.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To sum up, cron expressions used here have a precision of one second. The following special strings can be used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>@minutely</li>
            <li>@hourly</li>
            <li>@midnight or @daily</li>
            <li>@weekly</li>
            <li>@monthly</li>
            <li>@annualy or @yearly</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Things to know</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The pulse rhythm configuration sets the pace of the {@link Scheduler} heartbeat. If you run several
                schedulers in the same application with the same pulse rhythm they will be synchronous. Plus, if you run
                several schedulers in several applications in different computers with the same pulse rhythm they will
                be synchronous if the computers clocks are synchronous.</li>
            <li>Remember that the pulse rhythm dictate the precision of the scheduler, by default it is set at 60
                seconds and allow to schedule with a minutely precision, if you want to go seconds, change it
                accordingly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the {@link UnitOfWork} handling in Qi4j, you can split the work done in your {@link Task}s in
                several {@link UnitOfWork}s, the one around the {@link Task#run()} invocation will then be paused.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Observing the Timeline</h3>
        <p>{@link Timeline} allow to browse in past and future Task runs. This feature is available only if you activate
            the {@link Timeline} assembly in the {@link SchedulerAssembler}, see above.</p>
        <p>Once activated, {@link ScheduleRunner}s record {@link Task} success and failures. Then, the {@link Timeline}
            service allow to browse in past (recorded) and in anticipated (future) Task runs.</p>
