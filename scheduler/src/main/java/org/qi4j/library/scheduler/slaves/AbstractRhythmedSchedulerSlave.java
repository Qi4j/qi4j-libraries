/**
 * Behavior common to {@link SchedulerPulse} and {@link SchedulerGarbageCollector}.
 * 
 * A rhythmed slave run at a given rhythm.
 * A rhythmed slave starts after a delay depending on the rhythm.
 * Rhythmed slaves triggered on clock synchronized systems with the same rhythm are in sync.
 * Clock skew due to multithreading is canceled on each cycle based on epoch.
 *
 * To compute the initial delay we take a common starting point of time: epoch.
 *
 * A rhythmed slave cycle must be as short as possible.
 *
 * When a cycle is longer than the rhythm itself, the next cycle will use the starting time
 * of the previous cycle when fetching runnable Tasks.
 *
 * What happens when a slave is locked?
 *  QUID Provide a configurable timeout and simply kill/miss the slave issueing an error log?
